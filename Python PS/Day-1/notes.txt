# problem solving

1 strings - string manipulation (index)
 palindrome,anagram,reverse,substring,longest substring
 number logic - number manipulation
 reverse,palindrome
2 prime,armstrong,perfect,fact,fibb
3 list - element,max,min.sec-max,sort(asc,desc), unique elements, duplicates remove
4 dict - access


# # number logic
146 - 1 is a character - number is a single unit and its not iterable
"kalyan" - it is a collection of characters

1.how to get a char from a number(extraction of a digit - concept)

digit = number%10 (temporary digit extraction)
number = number//10 (reducing number by removing last digit) 


2.how you can form a number with a char 1,4,6 - 146(formation of a number - concept)

we have a formula to form digit with removed characters
rev = 0
rev = rev*10 + digit

* Imp Points
- use while loop while working with numbers
- take a copy of number for comparision if requires ex: palindrome


basic programs:
# # sum of a number
# # multiplication of a number
# # reverse a number
# # palindrome - 121
